# Creating Users {#AgentDeskSetupAndUserGuide-CreatingUsers}

In order to create users you must have \(at least\) Supervisor privileges, and to create teams you must have \(at least\) Admin user rights. \(This means that, to get started, you may require the Super-Admin to create an appropriate role for you. Remember that it is easy to change a user’s role, if required.\)

1. From the main \(left\) menu select**Settings &gt; Users**. The**Users**page displays. \(The first time you do this the page will be empty. If you do not see the left menu click on the three lines at the top left of the page and the menu will slide in from the left.\)

2. Select the
   **+ New user**
   button. The
   **New user**
   modal page slides in from the right.

3. Fill-in the fields. You can leave the
   **Teams**
   field empty \(
   **-**
   \) for now.
 
 
   **Note:**The three roles you will use the most are Admin, Supervisor, and Registered User. Indeed, these three roles may be the only roles you ever need to define.

   For general business purposes an**Admin user**would define \(create/edit\) most of your agents at the**Registered User**credentials level. This will hide the complexity of the more advanced options and allow your users \(agents\) to serve your customers without worrying about any setup.

   There are three password options:

   * Create random password and send it via email
   * Create user without password
   * Define password
 
 

4. If you select the
   **Define Password**
   option two more input fields display where you can enter the password.

5. If you select
   **Create random password and send it via email**
   a message is displayed informing you of the password sent to the user.

6. Click
   **OK**
   to close the password message.
 
 
   At the same time the user is sent an email with the generated password.

7. When you are done defining user information click
   **Save**
   and then click the
   **X**
   to close the modal page. The new user displays immediately in the
   **Users**
   list.

   You can delete \(using the trashcan icon\) or edit \(using the pencil icon\) user definitions at any time using the two rightmost icons.

   The**Filter**field at the top of the page, and the**Group by**and**Sort by**drop-down lists help you to organize the view. The**Filter**field displays matches with whatever you type while the**Group by**and**Sort by**fields allow you to order search results.

   The ‘square with an arrow’ icon is a special feature that allows Super Admins to ‘impersonate’ another role. This is useful for Super Admins who may want to be able to see what their Admin, Supervisor or Registered Users see. But note that ‘impersonating’ a role means your credentials will change \(temporarily\). This icon is only visible to Super Admins. In order to ‘retrieve’ your proper role you need only to log out and then log back in with your proper credentials \(your user name and password\).

   Next, we will create the teams.
